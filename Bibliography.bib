    abstract = {Author Summary Understanding the computational and information processing roles of cortical circuitry is one of the outstanding problems in neuroscience. In this paper, we work from a theory of neocortex that models it as a spatio-temporal hierarchical system to derive a biological cortical circuit. This is achieved by combining the computational constraints provided by the inference equations for this spatio-temporal hierarchy with anatomical data. The result is a mathematically consistent biological circuit that can be mapped to the cortical laminae and matches many prominent features of the mammalian neocortex. The mathematical model can serve as a starting point for the construction of machines that work like the brain. The resultant biological circuit can be used for modeling physiological phenomena and for deriving testable predictions about the brain.},

    abstract = { Fifty years ago, Newell and Simon (1956) invented a “thinking machine” called the Logic Theorist. The Logic Theorist was a computer program that could prove theorems in symbolic logic from Whitehead and Russell's Principia Mathematica. This was perhaps the first working program that simulated some aspects of peoples' ability to solve complex problems. The Logic Theorist and other cognitive simulations developed by Newell and Simon in the late 1950s had a large impact on the newly developing field of information-processing (or cognitive) psychology. Many of the novel ideas about mental representation and problem solving instantiated in the Logic Theorist are still a central part of the theory of cognitive psychology, and are still used in modeling the complex tasks studied in human factors psychology. This paper presents some of the theoretical precursors of the Logic Theorist, describes the principles and implementation of the program, and discusses its immediate and long-term impacts. }
