## Proposal

The Proposal for my Honors Research Thesis was due April 30th, 2018 and it is complete, feel free to check it out and ask any questions you may have.

## Thesis

We've been playing with a few ideas, but have to find something achievable within our time frame. Right now we are working on trying to categorize the predictive power of Hierarchical Temporal Networks using ARIMA models as a function of some of their parameters (i.e. cells per column, number of layers, etc.). Stay tuned to see what I'm able to get done and what I end up working on!
