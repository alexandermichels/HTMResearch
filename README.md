## Thesis

We've been playing with a few ideas, but have to find something achievable within our time frame. Right now we are working on trying to categorize the predictive power of Hierarchical Temporal Networks using ARIMA models as a function of some of their parameters (i.e. cells per column, number of layers, etc.). Stay tuned to see what I'm able to get done and what I end up working on!
